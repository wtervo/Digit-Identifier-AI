A tool to recognize handwritten digits, i.e. the "Hello world!" of neural networks, .

Based on the wonderful book, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, by Michael Nielsen: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. Mostly chapters 1 & 2.
Author's original Python code can be found here: https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/network.py

This is a C# adaptation of Nielsen's code with added WPF UI. I wanted to learn neural networks on an intimate level and figured it would make a great challenge
and a learning experience to program one from the group-up. To do this, I would need to understand (well, mostly...) the inner workings of the network, especially
the learning principles and the math behind them.
